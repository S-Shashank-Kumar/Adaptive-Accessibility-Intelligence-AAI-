Adaptive Accessibility Intelligence (AAI)
________________________________________
1. Executive Summary
Adaptive Accessibility Intelligence (AAI) is a software-only AI layer designed to dynamically personalize digital experiences for users with diverse accessibility needs.
This initiative delivers an AI-driven platform capable of adapting digital content in real-time — including text, speech, and UI presentation — without requiring hardware, cameras, or sensors.
The initial implementation phase focuses on delivering a functional, deployable web-based solution designed for scalability, performance, and measurable business impact.

2. Problem Statement
Millions of users struggle with digital accessibility due to:
•	Dyslexia and reading comprehension challenges
•	ADHD and cognitive overload
•	Visual impairments
•	Auditory impairments
•	Motor or speech difficulties
•	Neurodiverse interaction needs
Current accessibility tools are:
•	Static (fixed large text / dark mode)
•	Manual (user must configure settings)
•	Fragmented (different tools for different needs)
•	Reactive (support comes after user struggles)
Users must adapt to systems. The system should adapt to the user.

3. Proposed Solution
Adaptive Accessibility Intelligence (AAI) introduces a software-based AI layer that dynamically modifies digital content based on user-selected accessibility needs.
The initial release focuses on:
•	Real-time text simplification
•	Dynamic UI adaptation
•	Text-to-speech output
•	Speech-to-text input
•	Optional summarization and predictive typing
The system operates entirely in the browser + backend AI APIs.

4. System Architecture Overview
 

4.1 Demo Web App (Frontend Layer)
•	User-facing web application
•	Displays content (articles, forms, communication interface)
•	Provides accessibility control panel
•	Communicates with the Embeddable JS SDK
4.2 Embeddable JS SDK (Client-Side Integration Layer)
This SDK can be embedded into any web application.
Core Capabilities:
•	Event Tracking (captures user interactions)
•	UI Injection (dynamically modifies DOM elements)
•	Contrast Mode & Accessibility Changes
•	Configurable API Calls to backend services
The SDK acts as the bridge between the frontend and AI backend APIs.
4.3 Call AI Backend APIs Layer
•	Secure API communication layer
•	Sends user content and configuration to backend services
•	Receives processed results (simplified text, speech output, summaries)
4.4 AI Accessibility Backend
Core Processing Services:
•	Text Adaptation Engine (simplification & readability adjustment)
•	Speech Processing Module (TTS/STT)
•	User Profile Management
•	Optional: Predictive Typing & Summarization Services
This backend handles all AI-driven transformations.
4.5 AI Compute & Caching Layer
Infrastructure components include:
•	AI Models (NLP & speech models)
•	User Profile Database
•	Inference Cache (performance optimization)
•	Compute acceleration layer
This layer ensures scalability, performance efficiency, and low-latency responses.
4.6 Compliance & Privacy Layer
•	Secure API communication
•	Data protection mechanisms
•	Privacy-aware user profile storage
•	Designed for accessibility compliance alignment (e.g., WCAG readiness)
This layered architecture ensures modularity, scalability, embeddability, and enterprise-grade extensibility.
